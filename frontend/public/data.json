This is within the 25.0% max position limit and available cash ($9,742.49) is sufficient.\n\n2. **TSLA SELL (Confidence 0.75)**: Vetoed. Rationale: The Strategist proposes a SELL, but the Current Positions list shows 0 shares of TSLA. Selling requires an existing position.\n\n3. **MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT, SOL/USDT, DOGE/USDT**: All Vetoed or Skipped. These are HOLD proposals, which do not result in orders. Additionally, the crypto tickers (BTC/USDT, etc.) are not in the provided price list, preventing execution even if they were BUY proposals.\n\nFinal decision: Execute BUY for AAPL.",

Do not assume or invent information.\n\nANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n- RSI: Below 30 = oversold (potential buy), Above 70 = overbought (potential sell)\n- MACD: Positive histogram = bullish momentum, Negative = bearish\n- Moving Averages: Price above MA20/MA50/MA200 = bullish trend structure\n- Price History: Look for patterns, support/resistance levels, volume trends\n\nFundamental Analysis:\n- P/E Ratio: Compare to sector/historical norms\n- Earnings Growth: Positive EPS growth is bullish\n- Profit Margins: Higher margins indicate competitive advantage\n- Debt/Equity: Lower is generally safer\n\nInsider Activity:\n- Net buying by executives is typically a bullish signal\n- Net selling may be concerning, but consider context (diversification)\n\nNews & Sentiment:\n- Positive news on products/earnings = bullish\n- Regulatory/legal issues = bearish\n- Sector/macro trends affect all stocks\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- Earnings proximity: Higher volatility expected near earnings dates\n- Consider whether to position before/after the event\n\nYou must respond with a JSON object matching this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"ProposedAction\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed trading action from the Strategist.\\n\\nUnlike OrderSide (BUY/SELL), this includes HOLD as an explicit option.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"BUY\",\n        \"SELL\",\n        \"HOLD\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"ProposedAction\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"TickerProposal\": {\n      \"description\": \"A trading proposal for a single ticker from the Strategist agent.\\n\\nThis is a simpler, more actionable output than TickerAnalysis.\\nIt focuses on WHAT to do rather than detailed analysis.\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"description\": \"Ticker symbol\",\n          \"title\": \"Ticker\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"action\": {\n          \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/ProposedAction\",\n          \"description\": \"Proposed action: BUY, SELL, or HOLD\"\n        },\n        \"confidence\": {\n          \"default\": 0.5,\n          \"description\": \"Confidence in this proposal (0.0 = no confidence, 1.0 = very confident)\",\n          \"maximum\": 1.0,\n          \"minimum\": 0.0,\n          \"title\": \"Confidence\",\n          \"type\": \"number\"\n        },\n        \"rationale\": {\n          \"default\": \"\",\n          \"description\": \"Brief explanation for the proposed action\",\n          \"maxLength\": 1000,\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"target_allocation_pct\": {\n          \"anyOf\": [\n            {\n              \"maximum\": 100.0,\n              \"minimum\": 0.0,\n              \"type\": \"number\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"null\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"default\": null,\n          \"description\": \"Suggested portfolio allocation percentage (e.g., 10.0 means 10% of portfolio)\",\n          \"title\": \"Target Allocation Pct\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\n        \"ticker\",\n        \"action\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"TickerProposal\",\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Output from the Strategist agent (LLM Call #1 in 3-Agent System).\\n\\nThe Strategist analyzes market data and proposes trading actions.\\nThis output is then reviewed by the Risk Guard agent.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"session_date\": {\n      \"description\": \"Trading session date YYYY-MM-DD\",\n      \"title\": \"Session Date\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"session_type\": {\n      \"description\": \"OPEN or CLOSE\",\n      \"title\": \"Session Type\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"market_summary\": {\n      \"default\": \"\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief overall market assessment\",\n      \"maxLength\": 1000,\n      \"title\": \"Market Summary\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"proposals\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed actions for each analyzed ticker\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/TickerProposal\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Proposals\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"session_date\",\n    \"session_type\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"StrategistProposal\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\n",

Do not assume or invent information.\n\nANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n- RSI: Below 30 = oversold (potential buy), Above 70 = overbought (potential sell)\n- MACD: Positive histogram = bullish momentum, Negative = bearish\n- Moving Averages: Price above MA20/MA50/MA200 = bullish trend structure\n- Price History: Look for patterns, support/resistance levels, volume trends\n\nFundamental Analysis:\n- P/E Ratio: Compare to sector/historical norms\n- Earnings Growth: Positive EPS growth is bullish\n- Profit Margins: Higher margins indicate competitive advantage\n- Debt/Equity: Lower is generally safer\n\nInsider Activity:\n- Net buying by executives is typically a bullish signal\n- Net selling may be concerning, but consider context (diversification)\n\nNews & Sentiment:\n- Positive news on products/earnings = bullish\n- Regulatory/legal issues = bearish\n- Sector/macro trends affect all stocks\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- Earnings proximity: Higher volatility expected near earnings dates\n- Consider whether to position before/after the event\n\nYou must respond with a JSON object matching this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"ProposedAction\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed trading action from the Strategist.\\n\\nUnlike OrderSide (BUY/SELL), this includes HOLD as an explicit option.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"BUY\",\n        \"SELL\",\n        \"HOLD\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"ProposedAction\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"TickerProposal\": {\n      \"description\": \"A trading proposal for a single ticker from the Strategist agent.\\n\\nThis is a simpler, more actionable output than TickerAnalysis.\\nIt focuses on WHAT to do rather than detailed analysis.\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"description\": \"Ticker symbol\",\n          \"title\": \"Ticker\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"action\": {\n          \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/ProposedAction\",\n          \"description\": \"Proposed action: BUY, SELL, or HOLD\"\n        },\n        \"confidence\": {\n          \"default\": 0.5,\n          \"description\": \"Confidence in this proposal (0.0 = no confidence, 1.0 = very confident)\",\n          \"maximum\": 1.0,\n          \"minimum\": 0.0,\n          \"title\": \"Confidence\",\n          \"type\": \"number\"\n        },\n        \"rationale\": {\n          \"default\": \"\",\n          \"description\": \"Brief explanation for the proposed action\",\n          \"maxLength\": 1000,\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"target_allocation_pct\": {\n          \"anyOf\": [\n            {\n              \"maximum\": 100.0,\n              \"minimum\": 0.0,\n              \"type\": \"number\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"null\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"default\": null,\n          \"description\": \"Suggested portfolio allocation percentage (e.g., 10.0 means 10% of portfolio)\",\n          \"title\": \"Target Allocation Pct\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\n        \"ticker\",\n        \"action\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"TickerProposal\",\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Output from the Strategist agent (LLM Call #1 in 3-Agent System).\\n\\nThe Strategist analyzes market data and proposes trading actions.\\nThis output is then reviewed by the Risk Guard agent.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"session_date\": {\n      \"description\": \"Trading session date YYYY-MM-DD\",\n      \"title\": \"Session Date\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"session_type\": {\n      \"description\": \"OPEN or CLOSE\",\n      \"title\": \"Session Type\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"market_summary\": {\n      \"default\": \"\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief overall market assessment\",\n      \"maxLength\": 1000,\n      \"title\": \"Market Summary\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"proposals\": {\n      \"description\": \"Proposed actions for each analyzed ticker\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/TickerProposal\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Proposals\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"session_date\",\n    \"session_type\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"StrategistProposal\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\n",

While the confidence (0.85) is high, the proposed allocation (8.0%) combined with the high share price ($256.99) requires a cash outlay of $2,055.92. This represents 20.56% of the total portfolio equity. While technically within the 25% limit, my risk management policy requires a buffer for transaction costs and slippage. I am vetoing this to maintain higher liquidity.\\n2. **AMZN (BUY):** VETOED. The confidence (0.72) is acceptable, but the allocation (6.0%) requires $1,458.36 (14.58% of equity). Combined with the approved AAPL trade, this would push exposure too high for a single session's entry. I am prioritizing the higher conviction AAPL trade.\\n3. **TSLA (SELL):** VETOED. You currently hold 0 shares of TSLA. You cannot sell what you do not own (Long-only constraint).\\n4. **BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT, DOGE/USDT (SELL):** VETOED. You currently hold 0 cryptocurrency positions. Additionally, these tickers are not in the provided list of available prices, making them unknown tickers (Hallucination risk).\\n5. **MSFT, NVDA, SOL (HOLD):** VETOED. These are HOLD proposals. The Risk Guard only generates Orders for BUY or SELL actions. HOLD proposals result in no order.\\n\\n**APPROVED PROPOSALS:**\\n1. **AAPL (BUY):** I am overriding the veto on AAPL to execute a scaled-down trade. The confidence is high (0.85), and the technical setup (oversold RSI 23.6) is valid. I will reduce the allocation to 5.0% to ensure the position size (1.94 shares) stays well within the 25% limit and preserves cash.\\n\\n**FINAL ORDERS:**\\n- **AAPL BUY:** Sizing calculated as ($10,000 * 5.0% / 100) / $256.99 = 1.945.
